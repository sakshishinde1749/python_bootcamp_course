# oops: object oriented programming

# attributes are variables and methods are functions

# class is any model like for ex. waiter and objects are blue prints of class for ex. waiter meena and waiter ram

# car = CarBlueprint(), here car is object and CarBlueprint() is class (first letter should be always capital)


import turtle

print(timmy)

timmy.forward(100)

# attribute(object) variable
my_screen = turtle.Screen()
print(my_screen.canvheight)

# attribute(object) methods
my_screen.exitonclick()
